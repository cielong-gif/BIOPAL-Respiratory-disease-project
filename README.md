This project analyzes how lifestyle and health factors affect respiratory outcomes using NHANES data. We examined lung function metrics (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio) and inflammation markers (CRP), and explored how they vary across smoking status, BMI categories, asthma diagnosis, and demographic variables. The analysis includes data cleaning, dataset merging, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and visualizations performed in Python using Google Colab
